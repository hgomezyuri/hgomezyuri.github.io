I am a Chilean lawyer from the Universidad de Chile and an LL.M. candidate at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu), currently working as a research assistant at the Global Private Law Project.

My research interests involve public law, comparative law, and political theory. In particular, I am interested in the theory and design of what the English-speaking literature has called fourth-branch institutions.

Previously, in Chile, I worked as a research assistant with Professor [Pablo Marshall](https://www.derecho.uach.cl/index.php/profesores/profesores-jornada-completa/18-cuerpo-academico/639-pablomarshallbarberan.html) on a Fondecyt Project and as a lecturer of courses related to legal theory at [UCSH](https://www.ucsh.cl/) and [UDP](https://www.udp.cl/).
