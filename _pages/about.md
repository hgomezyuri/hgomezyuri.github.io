</header>

I am a J.S.D. candidate at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu), where I obtained my LL.M. degree in 2024 as a Fulbright Scholar. I also hold an LL.B. from the University of Chile, where I served as a teaching assistant in the fields of legal theory, critical legal theory, and moral philosophy.

Before going to Yale, I taught courses on legal theory at the [Diego Portales University](https://derecho.udp.cl) and the [Catholic University Silva Henriquez](https://www.ucsh.cl/escuelas/escuela-de-derecho/). I was also a research assistant on a project for the Chilean National Research Fund for Science and Technology (Fondecyt) about the rights of people with disabilities, coauthoring pieces on issues such as autonomy, supported decision-making, and voting rights. Hernán has also published articles on legal theory, constitutional law, and human rights.

My academic interests are public law, comparative law, and political theory. In particular, my dissertation explores the design and development of fourth-branch institutions (organismos constitucionales autónomos) across Latin American constitutions and their impact on the practice of separation of powers and the system of checks and balances. My goal is to examine how these institutions interact with other branches of government in the context of presidential systems.
