I am a doctoral candidate (J.S.D.) at [Yale Law School](https://law.yale.edu). My research interests are constitutional law, comparative law, and political theory.

My dissertation explores the design and development of fourth-branch institutions (organismos constitucionales autónomos) across Latin American constitutions and their impact on the system of checks and balances.


I am currently working under the supervision of [Cristina Rodríguez](https://law.yale.edu/cristina-rodriguez) (chair), [Bruce Ackerman](https://law.yale.edu/bruce-ackerman) (reader), [Susan Rose-Ackerman](https://law.yale.edu/susan-rose-ackerman) (reader), [Nicholas R. Parrillo](https://law.yale.edu/nicholas-r-parrillo) (reader).
